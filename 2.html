    <a href="https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" target="_blank" title="css specification">
      <strong>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</strong>
    </a>
    is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document
    written in <a href="1.html">HTML</a> or XML (including XML dealects such as SVG, MathML, or XHTML).
    CSS describes how elements should be redered on screen, on papaer, in speech,
    or on other media.
  </p>
  <p>
    CSS is among the core language of the <strong>open web</strong> and is
    standardized across Web browsers according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/">W3C specifications</a>.
    Previously, development of various parts of CSS specification was done symchronously,
    which allowed versioning of the latest recommendations. You might have heard
    about CSS1, CSS2.1, CSS3. However, CSS4 has never become an official version.
  </p>
  <p>
    From CSS3, the scope of the specification increased significantly and the progress
    on different CSS modules started to differ so much, that it became more effective to
    develop and release recommendations separetly per module. Instead of versioning
    the CSS specification, W3C now periodically takes a snapshot of the latest stable
    state of the CSS specification.
